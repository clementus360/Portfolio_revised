# Portfolio_revised
I created a portfolio in a hurry because I wanted to show off my skills and get a job. I didn't get a job so I decided to redesign my portfolio and make it nicer all the while improving my Vue skills.
The project is built with Nuxt and I had a lot of fun working on it. For some reason Vue just feels easier to work with than React which I have been using for a while now.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
